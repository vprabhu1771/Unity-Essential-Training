# Unity Transform Shortcuts
In **Unity**, here are the default **keyboard shortcuts** for **Move**, **Rotate**, and **Scale** tools in the **Scene view**:

### 🔧 Transform Tool Shortcuts:

| Tool                         | Shortcut Key | Description                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Move**                     | `W`          | Select the **Move Tool** to move GameObjects.      |
| **Rotate**                   | `E`          | Select the **Rotate Tool** to rotate GameObjects.  |
| **Scale**                    | `R`          | Select the **Scale Tool** to resize GameObjects.   |
| **Rect Tool**                | `T`          | Useful for 2D UI elements.                         |
| **Transform Tool (Unified)** | `Y`          | Combines Move, Rotate, and Scale (in Unity 2020+). |

### 🖱️ Extra Tips:

* Hold **Ctrl (Cmd on Mac)** while moving for snapping.
* Hold **Shift** to duplicate and move (with some tools).
* Use the **Toolbar** at the top-left of the Scene view to switch between tools as well.

Let me know if you need the shortcuts for 2D or the newer Unity input system too.
